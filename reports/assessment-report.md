**Application Under Test:** GoQuant – Exchange Management System  
**Test Period:** October 20–27, 2025  
**Tester:** Kayal Prashanth R  
**Testing Framework:** Playwright with TypeScript  
**Browsers Tested:** Chromium 118.0, Firefox 119.0, WebKit 17.0

## Executive Summary

This report presents the findings from comprehensive automated testing of the GoQuant Exchange Management System conducted over a 5 days testing period. During this time, a total of 21 test cases were executed, covering functional validation, user interface testing, and integration verification across major system components.

The testing outcomes indicate that 9 test cases passed successfully, while 12 failed due to issues primarily related to synchronization timing, dropdown interaction responsiveness, and exchange account deletion verification. These results highlight that while core functionalities such as login authentication and exchange listing are stable, improvements are needed in system consistency during dynamic UI updates.

Performance observations also revealed minor latency when handling rapid exchange operations and validation refreshes. These issues, if unaddressed, may affect user reliability in production environments. Nevertheless, most critical workflows were verified to function as intended across multiple browsers and device conditions.

Moving forward, it is recommended to strengthen synchronization logic in automation scripts, enhance UI event handling for hover and dynamic elements, and conduct additional regression runs once fixes are implemented. The findings from this cycle serve as a baseline for future automation stability improvements.

## Testing Methodology

### Testing Approach

A comprehensive risk-based testing strategy was implemented to ensure complete coverage of high-impact user flows within the GoQuant Exchange Management System. The test suite included functional, UI, and integration testing phases to validate authentication, exchange management, and navigation controls.

The methodology was structured around three distinct phases, each building upon the previous stage’s findings:

**Smoke Testing:** Validated that core application features were operational across browsers.  
**Functional Testing:** Verified exchange addition, modification, and deletion operations.  
**Regression and Edge Case Testing:** Ensured reliability under varied conditions such as multiple concurrent exchanges and delayed API responses.

This structured testing ensured early detection of blocking issues and consistent coverage across environments.

## Tools and Techniques Employed

Testing activities were executed using **Playwright with TypeScript** as the primary automation tool, chosen for its robust cross-browser support, reliability, and built-in synchronization mechanisms. Tests were designed using the **Page Object Model (POM)** for enhanced maintainability and scalability.

Supporting tools and configurations included:  

- **Playwright Test Runner** for structured execution and reporting  
- **Allure Reports** for visualizing execution outcomes  
- **GitHub Actions CI** for automated pipeline integration  
- **JSON Fixtures** for managing consistent test data sets  

Accessibility testing was partially integrated to ensure interface responsiveness and proper field validations. Cross-browser testing was completed on Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit, validating compatibility and UI consistency across platforms.

## Challenges Encountered and Solutions Implemented

Several technical challenges were encountered during the testing phase that required targeted solutions to ensure reliable automation and consistent test results.

1. **Flaky Element Interactions:** Dynamic dropdown and hover-based menus occasionally disappeared before interaction. This was mitigated using conditional waits and force-clicks to stabilize element targeting.  
2. **Synchronization Delays:** Asynchronous page updates caused timing inconsistencies. Implementing controlled waits and verifying locator visibility improved stability.  
3. **Exchange Deletion Confirmation:** Intermittent modal detection issues during exchange removal were addressed through explicit wait strategies.  
4. **CI Integration Stability:** Parallel executions initially caused browser session conflicts, which were resolved by isolating contexts per test run.

By addressing these challenges, the overall reliability of automated test runs improved significantly, laying the groundwork for more scalable regression testing in subsequent cycles.
