## Executive Summary

The GoQuant Exchange Management System underwent a full automation testing cycle between October 22 and October 27, 2025. The purpose of this cycle was to validate end-to-end functionality across critical workflows including user authentication, account addition and deletion, order placement, order history validation, order book accuracy, wallet operations within GoOps, reconciliation modules, and system settings. The entire process was executed using Playwright with TypeScript, focusing exclusively on automated functional and UI validation.  

A total of twenty-one automated test cases were executed during this assessment period. Out of these, nine test cases passed successfully while twelve failed due to dynamic element instability, inconsistent backend synchronization, and forced interaction dependencies required for dropdown selections and confirmation modals. The testing effort provided deep insight into automation reliability, locator stability, and system responsiveness under different browser environments.  

Overall, the application demonstrated consistent performance in authentication, navigation, and UI rendering, with most failures concentrated in dropdown handling, order placement flows, and inconsistent API response timing. The results of this test cycle highlight the strengths of the system in core stability while also identifying specific technical challenges that need to be addressed to ensure more predictable automation outcomes in future test executions.

## Testing Methodology

The testing process was completely automated using Playwright integrated with TypeScript. The Page Object Model (POM) design pattern was implemented to structure automation scripts efficiently, ensuring that each module of the GoQuant system was represented as an independent, reusable class. The tests were written and executed entirely through Visual Studio Code, and all results were managed within the GitHub repository to maintain traceability and version control.  

Each test case was developed to replicate real user behavior across the system. The automation covered key modules including login authentication, exchange account addition and deletion, order placement, order book and order history validation, GoOps wallet verification, reconciliation confirmation, and settings configuration. Test cases simulated user journeys through the Admin dashboard, GoTrade, and GoOps environments to ensure seamless functionality between interconnected components.  

The test design emphasized accurate locator usage with robust synchronization handling. In scenarios involving dynamic dropdowns or slow UI rendering, explicit waits were applied, and force clicks were implemented where element stability was unreliable. Additionally, certain test cases used controlled delays and assertions based on visibility and text validation to confirm the accurate rendering of UI elements after asynchronous operations.  

All tests were executed across Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit browsers to confirm multi-browser compatibility. Execution results were reviewed after each run to evaluate both success rates and script reliability. Traces and video recordings generated by Playwright were analyzed to identify failure points, confirm synchronization gaps, and validate backend behavior against frontend actions. The complete execution was designed to mirror actual user workflows as closely as possible while ensuring automation consistency and precision.

## Tools and Techniques Employed

Playwright with TypeScript was the primary framework used for the end-to-end automation of the GoQuant system. Playwright was chosen for its modern cross-browser testing capabilities, powerful synchronization management, and support for parallel execution, which allowed the test suite to run efficiently across multiple environments. Visual Studio Code was used as the integrated development environment for writing, executing, and debugging scripts, while GitHub was utilized for version control and repository management.  

The automation relied heavily on advanced Playwright locators, particularly XPath and data-testid-based selectors, to handle dynamic UI components. Several modules required the use of `force: true` during click actions to bypass intermittent issues where elements were visible but not interactable due to frontend rendering delays. Explicit waits and assertions were incorporated to ensure each test action was executed only after the UI reached a stable state.  

Each automation script was structured using the Page Object Model, where reusable methods represented user actions such as login, navigation, exchange addition, deletion, order placement, and reconciliation verification. This modular approach not only improved readability and maintainability but also allowed for rapid debugging and efficient updates when UI changes occurred.  

The Playwright test runner was configured to capture screenshots and generate HTML reports for each run, allowing detailed analysis of failure points. Network traces and console logs were reviewed for each failed test case to determine whether the issue originated from the frontend, backend, or automation timing. Through this process, the automation coverage was comprehensive, and system performance under automation conditions was effectively validated.

## Challenges Encountered and Solutions Implemented

During the test cycle, several automation-specific challenges were encountered that required adaptive handling. One of the most persistent issues was the instability of dropdown menus, which often failed to remain open long enough for selection. This caused multiple test cases involving exchange selection, account addition, and settings configuration to fail intermittently. To overcome this, forced interactions were applied, and explicit waits were introduced to synchronize UI readiness before performing actions.  

Another major challenge involved inconsistent backend synchronization during account addition and order placement. While the UI reflected successful completion, API responses were delayed or inconsistent, causing validation steps to fail. This behavior led to discrepancies between expected and observed states during test assertions. The issue was mitigated by increasing wait durations, introducing `waitForSelector()` validations, and rechecking API status before proceeding to subsequent test steps.  

Order placement was particularly affected by backend delays and unresponsive UI elements. In several runs, orders could not be placed successfully even when input values were valid. The automation was enhanced to include multiple validation layers that checked order submission confirmation and subsequent reflection in the Order Book and Order History sections.  

GoOps wallet and reconciliation modules also exhibited synchronization issues, where UI updates lagged behind backend responses, resulting in inaccurate validation of wallet balances and reconciliation entries. Although this issue was beyond the scope of frontend automation fixes, enhanced waits and validation conditions were added to improve script reliability.  

Finally, within the Settings module, hover-based dropdowns frequently caused failed interactions as they collapsed before selection actions were completed. Playwright’s hover actions and event listeners were implemented to maintain focus during interaction, increasing test consistency. These adjustments collectively improved overall test stability, even under dynamic and asynchronous system conditions.

## Detailed Findings

### Critical Issues

**CRIT-001: Add multiple exchange accounts with API credentials**

**Severity:** Critical  
**Browser:** All  
**Description:** Adding an account is inconsistent — sometimes it succeeds, sometimes it throws an error.

**Steps to Reproduce:**  
1. Log in and go to **Admin → Add Exchange**  
2. Add **OKX** with valid API key and secret  
3. Repeat for **Binance USDM** and **Binance CoinM**  
4. Observe whether each account is added successfully  

**Expected Behavior:**  
All exchanges should be added successfully, each showing the status “Connected to the exchange” with no error messages.  

**Actual Behavior:**  
Using the same credentials, account addition sometimes succeeds and sometimes fails with the error “UDP Server Error.”.Previously added accounts show the status “Can’t communicate with exchanges.”
